Developed a full-stack web application using STS (Spring Tool Suite) and VS Code as the development environments.

Frontend: 
Utilized React.js library for building the user interface.
Used Bootstrap framework for designing responsive and visually appealing web pages.
Implemented Axios library to handle HTTP requests and interact with the backend APIs.
Utilized React Router to enable seamless navigation and create a single-page web application experience.
Leveraged React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.) for efficient state management and component lifecycle operations.

Backend: 
Implemented the application's backend using Java programming language and Spring Boot framework.
Developed RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, adhering to industry-standard REST principles for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.
Utilized Spring Data JPA, a subproject of Spring Boot, for simplifying database operations and interacting with the MySQL database.
Implemented security measures such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication and authorization to protect sensitive endpoints.

Database: 
Employed MySQL as the relational database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently.
Designed the database schema, including tables, relationships, and constraints, to ensure data integrity.
Utilized SQL queries and Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Server: 
Deployed the application on the Apache Tomcat Server, a popular Java-based web server and servlet container.
Configured the server to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate controllers.

Testing: 
Utilized Postman, a popular API testing tool, to verify the functionality and performance of the backend APIs.

Version Control: 
Used Git for version control, enabling team collaboration and managing code changes efficiently.
Leveraged GitHub as a remote repository to store and share code with team members.

Deployment: 
Utilized continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, such as Jenkins or GitLab CI, to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
Configured deployment scripts to deploy the application to production or staging environments seamlessly.
